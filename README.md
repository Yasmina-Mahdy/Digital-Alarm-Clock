# Digital-Alarm-Clock
## Overview
This is a project that was created for the Digital Design I course, taught at the American University in Cairo in the Spring 2024 semester, under the instruction of Dr. Mohamed Shalan.
This project is an implementation of a digital alarm clock on the Basys3 FPGA using Verilog HDL.
## Features
* The Alarm has two main modes of operation: Clock and Adjust
* In the clock mode, the Alarm-Clock works as a normal HH:MM clock, with a blinker for the seconds
* In the adjust mode, the Alarm-Clock allows the user to either adjust the time of the running clock, or set an alarm that goes off when it reaches the same value as the running clock
* When the alarm goes off, the left
